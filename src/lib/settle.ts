 * in at most n-1 payments, but it misses free wins: if a subset of players already
 * nets to zero among themselves, that subset can be settled independently and every
 * extra independent subset saves exactly one payment. So the real problem is
 * "split the players into as many zero-sum groups as possible", which is a
 * subset-sum partition — NP-hard, but trivial at home-game sizes.
 *
 * We do an exact bitmask DP up to EXACT_LIMIT players and fall back to plain greedy
 * above that (which is still correct, just possibly one or two payments longer).
